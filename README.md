# LibrariesAndExamples
In this repository, you can see the implementation of certain tasks and examples. Also in the repository there are libraries that perform certain tasks.
## Content
* *JDBC* - Work with databases. Create a connection and process data. In the presence it is necessary to have the library "mysql-connector-java" and the corresponding database.
* *chat* - project "Chat". Connecting and forwarding messages. It is implemented through the server (which is located in the corresponding folder). Commands for the server are available. The server starts on the standard port "8192". After starting the server - it is necessary to run the main program in several instances (imitating several users). Running through the "Login.java"
  * log4j.properties - a file for setting up the logging.
* *networking* - a simple example of interaction with the server. The request is sent to the server, then returns.
  * DeepCloning - an example of the implementation of deep copy.
* *nio* - example of work "Non-blocking I/O, New I/O".
* *swing* - an example of creating a simple application on the "swing". Form using "JFormDesigner".
* *threads* - packer that stores the implementation of the "concurrent framework". Each class contains a description and an example of the following components:
  * BlockingQueue	
  * CallableAndFuture
  * Condition
  * CountDownLatch
  * CyclicBarrier
  * Exchanger
  * ExecutorService
  * ForkJoin
  * Lock
  * Phaser
  * SchedulerExecutorService
  * Semaphore
* *typeOfSorts* - examples of implementation of different sorting algorithms. Implementation through "Factory Pattern".
  * BubbleSort
  * MergeSort
  * QuickSort
  * SelectionSort


## Libraries
* *Serialization* - Library to serialize and deserialize data.
